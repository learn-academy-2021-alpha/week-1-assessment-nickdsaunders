# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: Is a block of code that can be reused and returns a desired outcome. You would use it to execute a task over and over again on different sets of information.

  Researched answer: a set of instructions detailing how to do a task. An encapsulated machine that can be called many times and give unique output. 



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: The .map() method iterates through a specified array and returns an array with the same number or values, the .filter() method returns a new array that only contains the values that meet the condition of the function.

  Researched answer: The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. This allows items in an array to be manipulated to the userâ€™s preference, returning the conclusion of the chosen manipulation in a new array. The filter() method creates a new array with the elements that pass a test implemented by the provided finction. This method is best suited for a particicular instance where the use must identify certain items in the array that share a common characterstic. 



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is used to execute code and return is what will be returned when exectuting code in a function.

  Researched answer: console.log() is a function that will write the argument value on the console. the purpose of return is to use the function return value like you would use a varible value. It is an actual value that will be returned as output when the condition is true.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: The outside info you are passing into the function that determines the output.

  Researched answer: An array-like object accessible inside functions that contain the values of the arguments passed to that function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: One person is the driver and thier job is to physically be typing the code. The other person is the navigator and their job is to communicate to the driver by watching what they are writing and proof reading thier code for mistakes.

  Researched answer: Two heads are better than one. Teamwork! The driver is responsible for diligently drafting code, while the navigator's job is to review and concentrate on the plan of action.



6. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Each time you loop through an array its called an iteration.

  Researched answer: Methods that operate on every item in an array, one at a time. These methods are cloely associated with loops.



7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer: The terminal can access any part of the computer and create or remove files and directories easily. You can also list contents of directories easily and apply other flags to view certiain things. Disadvantages are that it is hard to visualize where things are and can be confusing.

  Researched answer: 
  Advantages: This interface uses much less memor (RAM) in order to use compared to other user interfaces. Allows users to type in commands that can produce immediate results. Once familiar this method is much quicker and simpler. You can automate tasts such as using a batch file.
  Disadvantages: Commands have to be typed precisely. If there is a spelling error the command will fail. Can be confusing if you are new, there are a lot of commands that need to be learned. 



8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I enjoyed the combination of learning one topic and then folllowing it up with a pair programming challenge to help put the lesson to work.
